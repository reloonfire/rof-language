# ROF
ROF is a an interpreted, dynamically-typed and simple language.
## Backstory
ROF is born thanks to the amazing book written by Bob that everyone can read at this [link](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

Aiming not for performance, this language plays an important role in studying how a language is created and how an interpreter works.

The interpreter is written in GoLang under Apache 2.0 license
it is completely written by me and it will probably be a good mess or maybe not.

## TODO (apart from the book)

- Improve error system
- String operation
- Convert print to stdlib function, not builtin
- Add interactive shell

## Contributing

If you find errors (which are perhaps not written in the TODO) and you have a PR ready to fix them, feel free to send it!
